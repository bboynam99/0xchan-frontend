In reality it's just all a ruse to hide their true selves, they all really want to be used and manhandled like sluts because in reality they fear leadership and responsibility, they desperately search for someone to save them from their \"freedom\" and to make every single life choice for them; they have ingrained feminist ideals so hard in their brains that they suppress their basic nature of being led by a strong and firm figure and create this heavy double-think mentality. Why do you think most feminists enjoy rough sex or have rape fantasies even though they spend half their days complaining about those issues?"

I posted about this in QTDDTOTT but I would like some answers before this time tomorrow preferably so pardon me as I make a thread.Anyways, I am swapping the engine to a 1991 Subaru Legacy non turbo automatic. Before putting the new engine in, I have to take the old one out. Everything went well, except for these 2 bolts that attach to the motor mounts at the bottom. I saved these for last because this is my first time doing this big of a job and I have no idea what I am doing. No matter how hard I torque them, these bolts will not come out! >why won't these bolts come out? They are NOT rusted. I have a feeling the entire weight of the engine is on these motor mount bolts which I left for removing last. How do I proceed? Do I jack up the engine? Did I fuck up somewhere along the way?Any help is really appreciated.",

She hates it because the speedometer doesn't have a clear indicator of where 30 and 50 km/h is but shows 0,20,40,60,80 etc.Most local roads here are 30 or 50 and the fact that she needs to \"look closely\" to see if she follows the speed limit is such a hassle that she'd rather not drive it. I'm astounded, to say the least. She's perfectly reasonable in most other areas of life, and this is such an odd thing to get riled up about. She's fine with the CVT, fine with the difficult radio controls etc. She's NOT fine with this. Sorry, just needed to vent..Also, general woman drivers thread.",

So not really worth the time above minimum wage, but then we start considering that the lowliest flatbed typically spits out 16-bit TIFFs which you can import into Darktable and have your way with, not 8-bit Instagram-ready JPEGs that some pimply-faced youth slapped some \"clarity\" and \"grain\" onto. Do the math, how many rolls does it take for the scanner to have paid for itself in lab costs.Same with dev, except your choice of chemistry and it's done in about half an hour of effort per two or three rolls, and two hours for them to dry.Same with bulkloading at some 20€ saved per 30½m.Same with making your own photo paper and/or dry plates."
