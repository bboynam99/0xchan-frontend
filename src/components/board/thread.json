Rent, groceries, car, Insurance(s), if you're not breaking $40k a year, your paycheck can be eaten immediately by just living. That's the \"I'm reasonable smart\" story. Let's factor in reality: Credit Card Debt, buying cars too expensive for their budget, eating out more than cooking in, buying new phones every year. Every American is one bad medical bill away from being in debt. Americans are financially illiterate and get in over their heads. Wasn't there just some story about how most Americans can't cover a $400 random expense?I'm with you, it's absurd and \"no one taught me\" is a poor excuse, but it does make people poor before they even have a chance to process it."

		"text": ">>15398927Yeah, it is the adults responsibility to teach the children to survive and function in their society. If neither your parents (who signed you up for loan debt) or school (who also encourage loan debt) accurately explain finances to you, it's not a child's fault. It's a failing of the systems around you. That's just school debt. Do you understand how many kids have parents open lines of credit in their children's name and ruin them OR ask them to take on risky loans to assist them with their own financial incompetence? Do you think parents en masse are sitting down their kids at 17 to explain that once they step foot out that door, everyone is going to sell everything they can't afford to them? No. Because most parents are dumb fucks too. Most people aren't accessing the internet through a computer, it's through a phone which probably has a data limit. Your argument is paper thin and blaming children for not developing an inherit interest in passion for an area that is purposefully obscured by bullshit terms by the world's leading predatory industries is pretty cold and idealistic. Yeah, ideally your parents are retards, but here we are in a world of baby boomers who don't understand how inflation or mortgages work, back by the best marketing agencies in the world to make sure you sign up for your credit card bonsuses and \"Treat yourself\". At least taking a selfie is free."
